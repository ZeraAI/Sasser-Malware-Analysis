Regarding infamous malware called Sasser


**Abstract:**
It did not take even 20 minutes for Sasser to infect the world, just right after its illegal release on
May 1, 2004. By scanning every IP address publicly available across the globe at the time, 
Sasser sent packets which caused each infected computer to constantly shut down without any 
way to cancel it. Internet speeds have significantly dropped. Important financial institutions, 
government organizations, universities [7], hospitals are just a few of the infected names where 
disasters have occurred. The release of Sasser was a crime, which gave many blessings and 
detriments towards the worldâ€™s stance on cybersecurity, which will be covered throughout this
paper.
